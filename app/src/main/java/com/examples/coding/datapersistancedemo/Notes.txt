- Data Persistence
    - Saving data to non volatile memory
    - Data is retained after application is closed

    - 4 Different types of Data Persistence
        1. Shared Preferences
        2. Internal File Storage
        3. External File Strorage
        4. Relational Database - Sqlite

    - Shared Preferences
        - Used typically for non secure data
        - Shared preferences is a file kept along side the applications APK
        - Shared preferences uses Key/Value Pairs
        - Only primitive types and Strings are allowed
        - To save data to shared preferences,  you must go thru the Shared Preferences editor
            - Once the value is set in the editor you must either:
                - commit - Immediately, and returns boolean if the commit actually occured
                 - OR -
                - apply - Async. and does not have a return

    - Relation Database
        - Grouping of data by relation
        - Relation Databases have:
            - Tables
            - Columns
            - Entries (Entities)
            - Foreign Keys
            - Primary Keys - MUST BE UNIQUE
        - Generally (and i mean 99.9999999%) Uses SQL as the define structured langauge to
            interact with the database
        - Crud operations and SQL
            C - Create - Creating tables
                - EX: CREATE TABLE PERSON {
                    firstName String,
                    lastName String PRIMARY KEY
                }
            R - Read   - Getting data from tables
                EX: SELECT * FROM PERSON          - Get all entries and column values
                    SELECT firstName FROM PERSON  - Get all entries but only the firstName
                    SELECT * FROM PERSON WHERE lastName = 'Hoskins' - Get ONLY entries with the last name Hoskins
            U - Update - Changing state of tables or entries
            D - Delete - Removal of Entry
        - SQLite
            - SQLite is a very simplified DBRM - (program that controls the database)
            - 1 file per app
        - SQLite and Android practices
            - Generally broken into 2 separate parts
                - Database Contract
                    - Query Strings
                    - Column Names
                    - Table Names
                    - Database Name
                    - ect
                - Database Helper
                    - The database helper extends from the SqliteOpenHelper
                    - MUST override 2 methods
                        - onCreate
                            - Creates the tables
                            - only runs once unless invoked elsewhere
                        - onUpgrade
                            - Handles the updating of the database when the version of the database
                                is changed
                            - Called when current database version is not equal to current configuration
                        - Inserting and updating
                            - Uses ContentValues which is a data container with key/ value association
                                - KEY = Col (Or field)
                                - Value = value for that field
                        - Retreiving entries from Database
                            - Cursor
                                - Iteriable data container that holds all records retreived from the
                                    database query
        - File Storage
            - To Write to a file
                - 2 Objects
                    - FileOutputStream
                        - Access the file
                        - Parameters are:
                            - File Name
                            - Write Mode (PRIVATE)
                    - OutputStreamWriter
                        - Writes the value to the opened file
                        - parameter
                            - Value to write
            - To Read from a file
                - 2 Objects
                    - FileInputStream
                    - InputStreamReader
                - Input buffer
                - char to read current char in buffer
                - int to read current value in buffer
                - loop to cycle through the buffer
            - External File Storage
                - Requires permissions to read and/or write to External Storage
                - Check if External File storage is available
                - To get the the external file storage location, use the getExternalFileDir("<<FILE_NAME>>")
